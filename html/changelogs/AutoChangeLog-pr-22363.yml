changes:
  - balance: "Duffelbags will now only make you slow while they are unzipped. As a tradeoff, you now need to stand still and zip/unzip them to access their contents/not move real slow."
  - bugfix: "Fixes some fuck with duffelbags, them not holding enough + issues with spawning gear in them (job shit and all)"
