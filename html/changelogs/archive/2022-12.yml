      playing the does this ammo type go in my gun game with one of the several rounds
      with the same exact naming scheme.

      similar if not the exact same as it was per gun before this pr.

      stamina, ebow stamina/knockdown/blur) checked a generally nonexistent armor
      value that was defined on a per-/atom level. As a consequence, such auxiliary
      effects from projectiles now actually respect the armored equipment of hit targets/limbs/etc.

      based on the units of toxin present and their lethality.

      different and they won't move while you're pulling them anymore
