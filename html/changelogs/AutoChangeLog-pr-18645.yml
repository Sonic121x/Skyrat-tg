  - qol: "Successfully fending off a blob now has a cross station news report again. More pressing reports will take priority over it, though."
  - qol: "Successfully killing a wizard (and all of their apprentices) now has a cross station news report again."
  - qol: "If more than half of a cultist team manages to escape on the shuttle (rather than summoning Nar'sie), they will send a unique cross station news report. This is still a loss, by the way. Summon Nar'sie!"
  - qol: "Nuclear Operatives successfully nuking the station now has its unique cross station news report again, and no longer uses the generic \"The station was nuked\" report."
  - qol: "Nuking the station to stop a blob infection now has a unique cross station news report again. Good luck convincing admins to allow this."
  - qol: "Cult ghosts from \"Spirit Realm\" no longer persist on the cult's team after being desummoned, meaning they will not show up on roundend report."
  - qol: "Heads of staff will now always show up on revolution roundend report - even if their body was fully destroyed."
