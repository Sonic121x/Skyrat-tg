  - rscadd: "Adds a new 7 point positive quirk, \"Spacer Born\". You were born in space, and as a result your body's adapted to life in artificial gravity, making you much more effective and comfortable in lower gravity. However, travelling planet-side is quite a chore, especially if you're assigned to work there."
  - rscadd: "Adds a chemical: Ondansetron, created by Oil + Nitrogen + Oxygen + Ethanol catalyst. A powerful Antiemetic (lowers disgust)."
